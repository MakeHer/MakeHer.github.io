Being a university tutor for undergraduate subjects, I have also included some handy tutorial videos for undergraduate electronics. This is university level theory, but you do not have to understand it in whole to get an awesome electronics project going!

If you are interested in learning more tertiary level subjects, I recommend checking out [Coursera][CourseraLink] or [edX][edXlink] for some great MOOC courses.
